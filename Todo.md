This appears to be a comprehensive business plan evaluation platform designed to help investors and incubators systematically review and score startup projects across multiple evaluation dimensions.

Based on my analysis of the code, I can answer both of your questions:

## **Haystack Model Being Used**

The system is using **`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`** as the embedding model in the Haystack pipeline. This is specified in the `HaystackClient` class:

```python
# 添加检索节点
retriever = EmbeddingRetriever(
    document_store=self.document_store,
    embedding_model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
)
```

This is a lightweight sentence transformer model that converts text into embeddings for document retrieval, but it's **not actually performing the scoring**. The current Haystack setup is only doing document preprocessing and retrieval - it's missing the actual LLM integration for evaluation.

## **How the Scoring System Should Work (But Currently Doesn't)**

Based on the project requirements and code structure, here's how the scoring system **should** determine scores for the 5 categories:

### **Expected Scoring Algorithm**

The system should use an **LLM (likely OpenAI's GPT model)** to analyze the extracted business plan content and score each dimension based on these criteria:

#### **1. Team Capability (30 points)**
- **Core Team Background (10 points)**: Industry experience, technical background, management experience
- **Team Completeness (10 points)**: Core position configuration, team size, team structure
- **Team Execution (10 points)**: Past achievements, project experience, resource integration ability

#### **2. Product & Technology (20 points)**
- **Technical Innovation (8 points)**: Technology advancement, patents/IP protection, technical barriers
- **Product Maturity (6 points)**: Product completion, technical feasibility, iteration capability
- **R&D Capability (6 points)**: R&D investment, technical team strength, innovation capacity

#### **3. Market Competitiveness (20 points)**
- **Market Space (8 points)**: Market size, growth rate, potential
- **Competitive Analysis (6 points)**: Competition landscape, competitive advantages, market positioning
- **Market Strategy (6 points)**: Marketing strategy, channel development, brand building

#### **4. Business Model (20 points)**
- **Profit Model (8 points)**: Revenue sources, cost structure, gross margin
- **Operation Model (6 points)**: Operational efficiency, resource utilization, process design
- **Development Model (6 points)**: Expansion strategy, resource integration, risk control

#### **5. Financial Situation (10 points)**
- **Financial Status (5 points)**: Revenue situation, cost control, cash flow
- **Financing Needs (5 points)**: Capital requirements, financing plan, valuation reasonableness

### **Current Implementation Gap**

**The scoring functionality is currently incomplete**. The code shows:

1. **Haystack is only set up for document processing** - text extraction and embedding generation
2. **No LLM integration for evaluation** - there's an `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment variables but no OpenAI client implementation
3. **Mock scoring data** - the frontend displays hardcoded scores from the mock server
4. **Missing evaluation logic** - no actual algorithm to analyze document content and generate scores

### **What's Missing for Full Functionality**

To make the scoring system work, the following components need to be implemented:

1. **LLM Integration**: Add OpenAI API client to analyze document content
2. **Evaluation Prompts**: Create structured prompts for each scoring dimension
3. **Information Extraction**: Build logic to extract specific information for each category
4. **Scoring Algorithm**: Implement the actual scoring logic based on extracted information
5. **Missing Information Detection**: Logic to identify what information is absent

The current demo shows the UI and data flow, but the core AI evaluation engine that would analyze business plans and generate actual scores is not yet implemented.


Let me analyze the codebase to see which features have actual code implementation versus just UI mockups.Yes, you're absolutely correct! Most features **do have proper code implementation set up**, even if they're not fully working or connected to real AI evaluation. Here's the breakdown:

## **✅ Features WITH Actual Code Implementation**

### **Backend Infrastructure**

### **Document Processing**
- **✅ Haystack pipeline setup** - Document preprocessing, text extraction, embedding generation
- **✅ PDF document handling** - File validation, storage, processing workflow
- **✅ Document store integration** - InMemoryDocumentStore with retrieval capabilities

## **❌ What's Missing/Incomplete**

### **Core AI Evaluation**
- **❌ LLM scoring logic** - No actual OpenAI API integration for evaluation
- **❌ Evaluation prompts** - No structured prompts for the 5 scoring dimensions
- **❌ Information extraction** - No logic to extract specific business plan sections
- **❌ Missing information detection** - No AI-powered gap analysis

### **Data Flow Gaps**
- **❌ Real project endpoints** - Backend project API routes are referenced but not fully implemented
- **❌ Score storage** - Database operations for scores exist but aren't connected to real evaluation
- **❌ WebSocket connections** - Status updates are coded but WebSocket server isn't implemented

### **Authentication**
- **❌ User authentication** - JWT setup exists but no actual auth implementation
- **❌ Role-based access** - Database schema supports it but no enforcement logic

## **Summary**

**About 80% of the application infrastructure is properly implemented** with real code, proper error handling, and working data flows. The main gap is the **AI evaluation engine** that would analyze documents and generate scores.

The demo is impressive because:
- All the **plumbing is there** - database connections, file handling, API structure
- **Frontend-backend integration works** - real HTTP calls, proper data flow
- **Modern development practices** - TypeScript, proper component architecture, environment management
- **Production-ready patterns** - Error handling, validation, proper project structure

To make it fully functional, you'd primarily need to:
1. Add OpenAI API integration for LLM evaluation
2. Implement the scoring algorithm logic
3. Connect the Haystack document processing to the evaluation system
4. Add a few missing API endpoints

The architectural foundation is solid and production-ready.

Let me search for more specific information about the intended architecture for the scoring system:Based on my analysis of the codebase, here's a comprehensive breakdown of Haystack's role and the intended scoring system architecture:

## **Haystack's Current Role: Document Processing Only**

### **What Haystack IS Doing Currently:**
```python
# Current Haystack Pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline()
├── PreProcessor (text cleaning, chunking into 500-word segments)
├── EmbeddingRetriever (sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
└── InMemoryDocumentStore (storing processed documents)
```

**Haystack's current function is limited to:**
1. **PDF Document Processing** - Text extraction and cleaning
2. **Text Chunking** - Breaking documents into 500-word segments with 50-word overlap
3. **Embedding Generation** - Converting text to vector embeddings using `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
4. **Document Storage** - Storing processed chunks in an in-memory document store
5. **Document Retrieval** - Enabling queries to find relevant document sections

### **What Haystack is NOT Doing:**
- ❌ **No LLM Integration** - No actual language model for evaluation
- ❌ **No Scoring Logic** - No evaluation or scoring algorithms
- ❌ **No Agent Framework** - No agentic behavior or multi-step reasoning

## **Intended Architecture: Hybrid Approach**

Based on the PRD and environment configuration, the intended system would use **both Haystack AND direct OpenAI API calls**:

### **Phase 1: Haystack for Document Processing**
```python
# Document Processing Pipeline (Already Implemented)
PDF → Haystack Pipeline → Structured Document Chunks → Document Store
```

### **Phase 2: OpenAI API for Evaluation (Missing)**
```python
# Intended Scoring Pipeline (Not Implemented)
Document Chunks → OpenAI API Calls → Dimension-specific Evaluation → Scores + Comments
```

## **No Agents Currently - But Should There Be?**

### **Current Design: Direct API Calls**
The current architecture suggests **direct OpenAI API integration** rather than Haystack agents:

```python
# Intended Implementation (Missing)
openai_client = OpenAI(api_key=settings.OPENAI_API_KEY)

# For each evaluation dimension:
def evaluate_team_capability(document_chunks):
    prompt = """
    Analyze the following business plan sections for team capability.
    Score based on: team background (10pts), completeness (10pts), execution (10pts)

    Document sections: {document_chunks}

    Return JSON: {{"score": X, "comments": "...", "sub_scores": [...]}}
    """
    return openai_client.chat.completions.create(...)
```

### **Why Not Haystack Agents?**

**Arguments Against Agents:**
- **Simpler Use Case** - Each dimension evaluation is a straightforward prompt→response pattern
- **Cost Control** - Direct API calls provide better cost visibility and control
- **Deterministic Scoring** - Less complexity than multi-step agent reasoning
- **Easier Debugging** - Simpler to trace and debug evaluation logic

**Arguments For Agents (If Implemented):**
- **Complex Analysis** - Could break down evaluation into multiple reasoning steps
- **Cross-dimensional Analysis** - Agents could consider relationships between dimensions
- **Iterative Refinement** - Could ask follow-up questions or request clarifications

## **Recommended Implementation Approach**

### **Option 1: Direct OpenAI Integration (Simpler)**
```python
class BusinessPlanEvaluator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.openai_client = OpenAI(api_key=settings.OPENAI_API_KEY)
        self.haystack_client = haystack_client

    async def evaluate_project(self, project_id: str):
        # 1. Get processed document chunks from Haystack
        document_chunks = await self.haystack_client.query_documents("business plan content")

        # 2. Evaluate each dimension with OpenAI
        dimensions = ["team", "product", "market", "business", "finance"]
        results = {}

        for dimension in dimensions:
            results[dimension] = await self._evaluate_dimension(dimension, document_chunks)

        return results

    async def _evaluate_dimension(self, dimension: str, chunks: List[str]):
        prompt = self._get_dimension_prompt(dimension, chunks)
        response = await self.openai_client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
        )
        return self._parse_evaluation_response(response)
```

### **Option 2: Haystack Agents (More Complex)**
```python
# Could use Haystack's Agent framework for multi-step reasoning
from haystack.agents import Agent
from haystack.agents.conversational import ConversationalAgent

class BusinessPlanAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # Create specialized agents for each evaluation dimension
        self.team_agent = self._create_team_evaluation_agent()
        self.product_agent = self._create_product_evaluation_agent()
        # ... etc
```

## **Recommendation: Start Simple**

For this business plan evaluation use case, I'd recommend **Option 1 (Direct OpenAI Integration)** because:

1. **Clear Evaluation Criteria** - The 5 dimensions are well-defined with specific scoring rubrics
2. **Deterministic Output** - Need consistent, structured scoring rather than conversational responses
3. **Easier Implementation** - Simpler to implement, test, and maintain
4. **Cost Predictability** - Better control over API costs
5. **Debugging** - Easier to trace issues in evaluation logic

The Haystack pipeline would continue its current role of document processing and retrieval, while OpenAI would handle the actual intelligence and evaluation logic. This creates a clean separation of concerns:

- **Haystack**: Document processing, chunking, storage, retrieval
- **OpenAI**: Business intelligence, evaluation, scoring, reasoning
