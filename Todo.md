I'll search the project knowledge to understand what features are working in this demo by examining the readme, frontend, and backend code.Let me search for more specific information about the backend and frontend functionality:Now let me search for frontend components and features:Let me search for more information about the models and services:Based on my analysis of the project knowledge, I can explain what features are working in this PitchAI demo:

## PitchAI - Intelligent Project Incubation Review System

**PitchAI** is an AI-powered business plan evaluation and project incubation review system. Here are the working features in this demo:

### **Frontend Features (Next.js)**

   - Comment generation for evaluation insights
   - Missing information detection

## **How the Scoring System Should Work (But Currently Doesn't)**

Based on the project requirements and code structure, here's how the scoring system **should** determine scores for the 5 categories:

### **Expected Scoring Algorithm**

The system should use an **LLM (likely OpenAI's GPT model)** to analyze the extracted business plan content and score each dimension based on these criteria:

#### **1. Team Capability (30 points)**
- **Core Team Background (10 points)**: Industry experience, technical background, management experience
- **Team Completeness (10 points)**: Core position configuration, team size, team structure
- **Team Execution (10 points)**: Past achievements, project experience, resource integration ability

#### **2. Product & Technology (20 points)**
- **Technical Innovation (8 points)**: Technology advancement, patents/IP protection, technical barriers
- **Product Maturity (6 points)**: Product completion, technical feasibility, iteration capability
- **R&D Capability (6 points)**: R&D investment, technical team strength, innovation capacity

#### **3. Market Competitiveness (20 points)**
- **Market Space (8 points)**: Market size, growth rate, potential
- **Competitive Analysis (6 points)**: Competition landscape, competitive advantages, market positioning
- **Market Strategy (6 points)**: Marketing strategy, channel development, brand building

#### **4. Business Model (20 points)**
- **Profit Model (8 points)**: Revenue sources, cost structure, gross margin
- **Operation Model (6 points)**: Operational efficiency, resource utilization, process design
- **Development Model (6 points)**: Expansion strategy, resource integration, risk control

#### **5. Financial Situation (10 points)**
- **Financial Status (5 points)**: Revenue situation, cost control, cash flow
- **Financing Needs (5 points)**: Capital requirements, financing plan, valuation reasonableness


### **What's Missing for Full Functionality**

To make the scoring system work, the following components need to be implemented:

1. **LLM Integration**: Add OpenAI API client to analyze document content
2. **Evaluation Prompts**: Create structured prompts for each scoring dimension
3. **Information Extraction**: Build logic to extract specific information for each category
4. **Scoring Algorithm**: Implement the actual scoring logic based on extracted information
5. **Missing Information Detection**: Logic to identify what information is absent

The current demo shows the UI and data flow, but the core AI evaluation engine that would analyze business plans and generate actual scores is not yet implemented.


Let me analyze the codebase to see which features have actual code implementation versus just UI mockups.Yes, you're absolutely correct! Most features **do have proper code implementation set up**, even if they're not fully working or connected to real AI evaluation. Here's the breakdown:

## **✅ Features WITH Actual Code Implementation**

### **Backend Infrastructure**
- **✅ FastAPI server setup** - Complete with proper routing, middleware, CORS
- **✅ Database integration** - Supabase client properly configured with connection handling
- **✅ Data models** - Pydantic models for business plans, projects, scores with proper validation
- **✅ File storage service** - Complete file upload/management system with proper file handling
- **✅ Environment configuration** - Settings management with proper environment variable handling
- **✅ Database migrations** - SQL scripts for table creation with proper relationships

### **Frontend Infrastructure**
- **✅ Next.js 14 setup** - Complete modern React framework with TypeScript
- **✅ Tailwind CSS styling** - Comprehensive design system implementation
- **✅ API client layer** - Axios-based HTTP client with proper error handling
- **✅ Component architecture** - Reusable components with proper props and state management
- **✅ Routing** - Next.js app router with dynamic routes for projects

### **UI Components (Fully Functional)**
- **✅ Dashboard with statistics** - Real API calls to fetch and display data
- **✅ Project creation form** - Complete form handling with validation
- **✅ File upload interface** - Drag & drop, file validation, progress tracking
- **✅ Project listing** - Pagination, filtering, search functionality
- **✅ Project detail pages** - Multiple views (detail, report) with proper navigation
- **✅ Score editing interface** - Interactive forms for modifying evaluation scores
- **✅ Report download functionality** - File download handling


## **❌ What's Missing/Incomplete**

### **Core AI Evaluation**
- **❌ LLM scoring logic** - No actual OpenAI API integration for evaluation
- **❌ Evaluation prompts** - No structured prompts for the 5 scoring dimensions
- **❌ Information extraction** - No logic to extract specific business plan sections
- **❌ Missing information detection** - No AI-powered gap analysis

### **Data Flow Gaps**
- **❌ Real project endpoints** - Backend project API routes are referenced but not fully implemented
- **❌ Score storage** - Database operations for scores exist but aren't connected to real evaluation
- **❌ WebSocket connections** - Status updates are coded but WebSocket server isn't implemented

### **Authentication**
- **❌ User authentication** - JWT setup exists but no actual auth implementation
- **❌ Role-based access** - Database schema supports it but no enforcement logic

### **Document Processing**

### **API Endpoints**

```
**Status:** ❌ Missing (commented out)
**Frontend calls:** `authApi.login(username, password)`

---

## 5. **WebSocket Support** (Medium Priority)

### 5.1 Real-time Status Updates
```
WS /ws/projects/{project_id}/status
```
**Status:** ❌ Missing
**Used by:** Real-time processing status updates

---

## Implementation Priority

### **Phase 1 - Critical (Required for basic functionality)**
1. ✅ **Project CRUD endpoints** (1.1 - 1.4)
2. ✅ **Scoring endpoints** (2.1 - 2.3)

### **Phase 2 - Important (Enhanced functionality)**
3. **Report endpoints** (3.1 - 3.2)
4. **WebSocket support** for real-time updates

### **Phase 3 - Future (Authentication & Security)**
5. **Authentication system**
6. **User management**
7. **Role-based access control**

---

## Database Requirements

These endpoints will require the following database tables (some may already exist):

### **Required Tables:**
- `projects` - Project information
- `scores` - Evaluation scores and comments
- `missing_information` - Tracking missing data
- `reports` - Generated report metadata
- `users` - User authentication (future)

### **Sample Project Table Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE projects (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    enterprise_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    project_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending_review',
    total_score INTEGER,
    review_result VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

---

## Quick Start Implementation

**To get the frontend working immediately:**

1. **Create `backend/app/api/v1/projects.py`** with the endpoints from Phase 1
2. **Register the router** in `main.py`
3. **Implement basic database operations** using the existing Supabase client
4. **Add mock data fallbacks** for development

**The mock server already has all these endpoints working** - you can use it as a reference for the expected request/response formats.

---

## Notes

- **Mock server is complete** - Use `frontend/mock/server.js` as the API contract reference
- **Database client exists** - Supabase integration is already set up
- **File storage works** - Business plan upload functionality is implemented
- **Basic evaluation framework exists** - Need to connect scoring logic to endpoints

The main gap is implementing the **project management and scoring APIs** that the frontend expects.
